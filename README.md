# My My Tang's Portfolio

## Description

This is a web application is the portfolio to show off all of My My Tang's work during the course of the UPenn Fullstack Web Development curiculum. 

FIRST PROJECT:
The Daring Dinosaurs Dictionary is a website that seamlessly integrates three powerful APIs: YouTube, Wikipedia, and Dictionary. By leveraging the power of these APIs, the website enables users to effortlessly search for a word and receive a wealth of information, including its definition, related Wikipedia articles, and informative videos. The development of this website was motivated by a desire to create a valuable tool for English learners and anyone looking to expand their vocabulary. With the Daring Dinosaurs Dictionary, learning new words and concepts has never been easier or more engaging.

SECOND PROJECT:
Do you know the feeling of traveling with a group of friends or colleagues from different cities and having to endure the worst part of it all - the long wait at the airport? Imagine being able to plan your flights around each other's arrival times to reduce waiting time and maximize the time spent together. This is exactly what Travel Easier was designed for. Travel Easier is a collaborative group project that enables a group of friends or members who are located far apart to select flights that arrive at similar times, thereby minimizing airport waiting time. With Travel Easier, your travel experience will be smoother, more efficient, and more enjoyable.
