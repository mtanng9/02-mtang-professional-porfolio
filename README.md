# My My Tang's Portfolio

## Description

This is a web application is the portfolio to show off all of My My Tang's work during the course of the UPenn Fullstack Web Development curiculum. 

FIRST PROJECT:
My first project is a website that incoporates 3 APIS: Youtube, Wikipedia, and Dictionary. This website allows user to search a word and have a definition, wikipedia articles and videos be returned. The motivation for the development of this website is for it to serve as a useful tool for English learners or those who want to build more vocabularies. 

Below is the revelant links to my first project.

SECOND PROJECT:
Do you know the feeling of traveling with a group of friends or colleagues from different cities and having to endure the worst part of it all - the long wait at the airport? Imagine being able to plan your flights around each other's arrival times to reduce waiting time and maximize the time spent together. This is exactly what Travel Easier was designed for. Travel Easier is a collaborative group project that enables a group of friends or members who are located far apart to select flights that arrive at similar times, thereby minimizing airport waiting time. With Travel Easier, your travel experience will be smoother, more efficient, and more enjoyable.
