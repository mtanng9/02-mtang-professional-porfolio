# My My Tang's Portfolio

## Description

This is a web application is the portfolio to show off all of My My Tang's work during the course of the UPenn Fullstack Web Development curiculum. 

FIRST PROJECT:
My first project is a website that incoporates 3 APIS: Youtube, Wikipedia, and Dictionary. This website allows user to search a word and have a definition, wikipedia articles and videos be returned. The motivation for the development of this website is for it to serve as a useful tool for English learners or those who want to build more vocabularies. 

Below is the revelant links to my first project.
